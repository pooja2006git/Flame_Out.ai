## 🧠 What is Flame Out.AI?

**Flame Out.AI** is an interactive puzzle game based on the *Vertex Cover Problem* — a famous problem from Graph Theory and AI.

Your objective:
👉 Identify the minimum number of vertices required to disable all fire-nodes (edges).  
Every move changes the graph. Every choice matters.

## 🎮 How to Play

| Action | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Click a node | Select / unselect a vertex |
| 🔥 Connected red edges | Active fire paths |
| 🧊 Goal | Turn off all fire paths using as few nodes as possible |

🟡 *Think strategically — selecting fewer nodes gives you a higher score!*

---

## 🏆 Game Rules

1. You must choose nodes such that every fire-edge is "covered."
2. You win when all edges are deactivated (turned gray).
3. Lower number of selected nodes = higher score.
4. Every move counts — choose wisely!

> This is a variation of an NP-Hard problem…
> …but trust your brain — not brute force 😁
